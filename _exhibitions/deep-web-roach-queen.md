DEEP WEB ROACH QUEEN is voidLabâ€™s very first exhibition featuring works from (female) students of the DMA department at UCLA, and promoting female presence in art and technology. The projects shown are alive as one hive; glistening and absorbent, they infect each other in a communal space. The works included are of sculpture, video, print, and interactive art.
