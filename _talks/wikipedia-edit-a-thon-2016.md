Systemic bias in Wikipedia results from a disproportionate rate of women contributors (15%) and editors (8.5%). Notable women from history and contemporary life are underrepresented in this online platform, meaning: they are not getting the recognition they deserve. Co-organized with the [UCLA Arts Library](http://www.library.ucla.edu/arts "UCLA Arts Library"), people of all gender identities are welcomed to join us to write women back into history for the digital age.
