title: Art + Feminism 2016 Wikipedia Edit-a-thon
type: talk
description: >
  Systemic bias in Wikipedia results from a disproportionate rate of women contributors (15%) and editors (8.5%). Notable women from history and contemporary life are underrepresented in this online platform, meaning: they are not getting the recognition they deserve. Co-organized with the UCLA Arts Library, people of all gender identities are welcomed to join us to write women back into history for the digital age.
location: UCLA Broad Art Center

  This event was made possible by the generous support from Art + Feminism and the UCLA Arts Library.
  With special thanks to Janine Henri, Margarita Nafpaktitis, and Stacey Allan.
